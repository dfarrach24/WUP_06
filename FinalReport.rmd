# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?.  If you skimp in this section expect to be marked down in your grade. Paint a picture of the project a couple of paragraphs is expected!-->

Is attitude toward capitol punishment (cappun) independent of race (race)?
If not, then whose view differs from whom??

$H_0$: There is no difference in attitude towards capital punishment  ( cappun) based on race.  
$H_A$: There is a significant difference in attitude towards capital punishment (cappun) based on race.  




# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method. Discuss what data manipulations may be needed for example subsetting or other binning procedures and what sort of graphical displays and inferential tools will be used!-->

the CAT_CAT helper file will be used due to both variables provided being categorical because both the response variable and explanatory variables are both categorical. 

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question. Bottom line is to explain the features of the graph that are relevant to conforming or departing to what is expected by your null hypothesis !-->


```{r}
barchartGC(~race + cappun,data=mydata)
barchartGC(~race + cappun,data=mydata, type="percent")

```

There is a significant difference in attitude towards capital punishment (cappun). Among the whites there are more who favor capital punishment (cappun) closer to 70%. While among the black race there are more who oppose capital punishment ( cappun) closer to 58%.   

## Now with The Most data (fewer variables gives more data points)



### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->




```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~race + cappun, data=mydata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```


Based on the percentages, the white race favors capital punishment by 65%, blacks at 42% and other races favors by 55%.
Among those who oppose capital punishment the black race seems to oppose more against capital punishment by 57.37


## Now with More data



## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

  #        print only those tables, results if p-value < (1-confL)

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->


Based on the smaller and larger data set there is a significant difference in attitude towards capital punishment based on race. In this larger data set there is a difference in attitude towards capital punishment in all three races. In the smaller data set there was a significant in attitude towards capital punishment between white and black, and there was not enough data to determine if other races have a difference in attitude towards capital punishment. In the large data set there was three contingency tables reflecting a difference in attitude towards capital punishment between "white and Other" , "Black and Other" and "White & Black"
